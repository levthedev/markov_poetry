a naked man is a crazy punctual excess, hyperbolic ex-timacy,
a vanishing mediator.

madness inscribes itself as the machinery which runs amok,
the starting point of a purely formal symbolic order: the big Other.

this big Other pulls not at the structure of truth but at madness imaginable,
oscillating between hyperbole.

cogito itself can only emerge through the abstract universe of narrative -
a turtle without feathers, a turtle without feathers.

soon, the monarch is reduced to the pure, the divine rays,
the exclusion of madness & dreams.
