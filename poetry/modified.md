the big Other
_____________

a naked man is a crazy punctual excess, hyperbolic ex-timacy,
a vanishing mediator.

cogito itself can only emerge through the abstract universe of narrative -
a turtle without feathers, a turtle without feathers.

soon, the monarch is reduced to the pure, the divine rays,
the exclusion of madness & dreams.
